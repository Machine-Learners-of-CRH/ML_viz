# Visualizing Neural Networks

## Why be interested in visualizing NNs? [This topic was helpfully addressed at NeurIPS2018, and I'll provide slides for some of what one Google research team shared there.]

### [Interactive Visualization of Node Links for CNNs](https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/fc/)
#### Description: This is an incredible visualization of the MNIST number recognizer that is frequently used as a "hello world" project for ML.  This site has several visualization tools, and an [accompanying paper](https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/harley_vis_isvc15.pdf). Not to be missed!

### [Tensorflow, Toy NN](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)
#### Description: Allows for quick and easy alteration of hyperparameters and settings, which provides a very helpful tool for understanding how adjusting the architecture or settings (weights, biases, activation) will provide different results.

### [Distill](https://distill.pub/2020/grand-tour/)
#### Description: There are several helpful visualizing tools here. "Even though neural networks are capable of incredible feats of classification, deep down, they really are just pipelines of relatively simple functions... Most of the simple functions fall into two categories: they are either linear transformations of their inputs (like fully-connected layers or convolutional layers), or relatively simple non-linear functions that work component-wise (like sigmoid activations or ReLU activations). "

### [ANN Visualizer](https://github.com/Prodicode/ann-visualizer)
#### Description: See [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-artificial-neural-networks-anns-with-just-one-line-of-code-b4233607209e) for general description. Might be a useful tool for some projects, if the NN architecture seems unwieldy.

### [KNNs Demo (Stanford CS231)](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n-demos/knn/)
### [Linear Classification Loss Visualization (Stanford CS231)](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n-demos/linear-classify/)
#### Description: Visualization tools that accompany [Stanford University's CS231](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/)

### [Feed Forward NNs, Visual Mathematics](http://jalammar.github.io/feedforward-neural-networks-visual-interactive/)
#### Description: This is another excellent set of visualization tools which provide views of the basic operations of NNs.
#### Don't miss [sigmoid activation](http://jalammar.github.io/feedforward-neural-networks-visual-interactive/#sigmoid-visualization) and [ReLU activation](http://jalammar.github.io/feedforward-neural-networks-visual-interactive/#relu-visualization)
